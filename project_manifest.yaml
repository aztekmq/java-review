name: jvmAnalyzer
summary: JVM tuning & diagnostics lab focused on production-ready, deep profiling features (YourKit style).
modules:
  - id: beginner
    path: beginner/
    responsibilities:
      - teach GC basics & telemetry
      - heap sizing and OOM
      - thread states and basic dumps
  - id: intermediate
    path: intermediate/
    responsibilities:
      - G1 GC tuning & GC logs
      - **memory leak diagnosis (Retained Size concept)**
      - **advanced lock contention (Deadlock simulation)**
  - id: advanced
    path: advanced/
    responsibilities:
      - low-latency GC (ZGC vs G1)
      - JFR profiling & Allocation Hotspots
      - **container-aware JVM & remote profiling setup**
      - **I/O and DB contention analysis**
  - id: analyzer
    path: analyzer/
    responsibilities:
      - parse JFR + optional GC log
      - **Produce multi-section JVM Health Report to stdout.**
      - **Report must include Top 5 CPU Hotspots (methods).**
      - **Report must include Top 5 Allocating Classes.**
      - **Report must include Deadlock Count and Top Contended Monitors.**
invariants:
  - "Each lab must compile standalone with javac (JDK 17+)."
  - "README and code filenames must stay in sync."
  - "Analyzer must always output GC pause, allocation, and CPU summaries if present."
  - "Analyzer must always include Top 5 Allocators and Top 5 CPU methods in its report."
  - "Analyzer must report Deadlock Count (even if 0)."
  - "No external services are required to run labs (simulations are fine)."
  - "Advanced labs must include configuration for remote/container profiling."
build:
  - "Top-level Makefile must support targets: beginner, intermediate, advanced, analyzer."
